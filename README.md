# begumyivli-DataStructureandAlgo
Projects I did for my Data Structures and Algorithms course.
In Student House Simulator, I implemented a Java program for simulating the distribution of student houses using queue.
In Discrete Event Simulation, I implemented a discrete event simulation with priority queues to organize a sport center’s schedule.
In Love Story, I implemented Dijkstra’s and Prim algorithm to find a shortest path in a honeymoon route using HashMap.
In Helping Santa Claus, I implemented push–relabel maximum flow algorithm to find optimal arrangement to distribute gifts.
